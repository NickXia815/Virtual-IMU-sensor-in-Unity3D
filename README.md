# Virtual-sensor-in-Unity3D

## Motivation
As the conventional sensor data obtain typicall required to recruit the real human to conduct the designated actitity to generate the sensor signal and collect the dataset, the cost of whole data obtain process is high and the trained machine-learning system is low-flexibility. To better create a flexible application which is able to fit the end-user's situation/requirement, minimizing the collection of sensor data will contribute to a low-cost and high-flexible system.  

## Method
As the accessible 3D reconstructed human motions are increased, measuring the 3D virutal human motion is able to simulate the way occuring in the real-world (e.g., using a physical sensor to detect the human motion) and generated the virtual sythetic signal.

## Environment 
Unity3D Platform with its Physics Engine.

## Realizing a virtual sensor design
### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
The IMU sensor normally detects the kinematic data. With it attached to the human body, the IMU can sense the acceleration, angular velocity and 

### Infrared distance sensor
